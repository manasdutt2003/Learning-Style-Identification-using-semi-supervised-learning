BACKGROUND
Online education (MOOCs, LMS) is rapidly growing but
often treats every student the same.
Research shows personalized instruction, tailored to
student learning styles, improves engagement and
outcomes:
Traditional identification uses static, self-report surveys
impractical, biased, and not scalable.
Advances in Al now enable real-time, behavior-based
learning style detection:

RESEARCH GAPS
1.Noscalable; real-time learuing_style detectiou in LMS: Most platforms lack
automated, real-time systems for identifying diverse learning styles, still relying
on
static, biased, and unscalable questionnaires.
2. Underuse_of advanced ML techniques: Modern post-202O machine learning
methods (hybrid-optimizer neural networks, graph learning with
clustering; ensemble boosting like LightGBMICatBoost)
remain largely
unexplored in educational data mining, which favors older models.
3. Scarcity_oflabeled data and labeling solutions: There is a persistent lack of
accurately labeled learning style data in large-scale educational settings, and
limited adoption of semi-supervised or weak-labeling methods that use
behavioral data.
4.Lack of explainability_and actionable insights: Most models offer little
interpretability for educators; explainable Al techniques connecting predictions
to
practical instructional actions are underdeveloped:

PROBLEM
STATEMENT
Existing LMS lack automated, real-time, and scalable
systems to identify and support diverse learning styles.
Most methods depend on lengthy questionnaires or small
datasets_
There is a need for a scalable, robust solution that infers
learning
from real behavior, using minimal labeled
data.

OBJECTIVE
Develop an AI-based system to predict students' learning
styles using LMS interaction
Leverage semi-supervised learning to work effectively
with limited labeled data.
Map behavioral features to the Felder-Silverman
Learning Style Model(FSLSM):
Build a dashboard for faculty to visualize learning style
distributions in classes

PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
DataCollection: Extract anonymized student activity
(video views, quizzes,
forums) from LMSIdataset.
Feature Engineering: Design features aligned with FSLSM axes.
DataPreprocessing: Handle missing data, balance classes
SMOTE).
Modeling:
1. Hybrid Optimizer-based Neural Networks
2. Graph Representation Learning +
C-Means Clustering
3 . Modern Ensemble Boosting Methods (LightGBM, CatBoost)
Use semi-supervised self-training for leveraging unlabeled data:
Apply ensemble modeling for improved accuracy.
Evaluation: Use metrics (accuracy, precision , recall), and ensure explainability
with SHAP.
Deployment: Develop dashboard/plugin prototype for faculty insights.
